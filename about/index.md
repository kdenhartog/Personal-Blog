Kyle Den Hartog is helping to promote a work where the web can be more private and secure for everyone. This vision led him to be an eager contributor to the design and development of standards in the decentralized identity space as well as other various specifications at W3C and IETF. Loaded with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science from the University of Iowa, a penchant for applied cryptography, cybersecurity and privacy-enhancing technologies and a need to further enhance mankind's symbiotic relationship with technology, Den Hartog launches himself headfirst into active like-minded communities that embrace these topics.

When Den Hartog isnâ€™t cooking internet standards for breakfast, eating code for lunch, and consuming knowledge for dinner, he enjoys skiing, bicycling, and traveling. Originally born and raised as an American, Den Hartog claims New Zealand as his new home after traveling there and falling in love with it's landscapes and laid-back culture.

Most recently Den Hartog has ventured out into the space of technical consulting where he offers a variety of technical services including secure software development, static code analysis for securing applications, cryptography code reviews, or advisement in the standards or decentralized identity spaces.
